What better to celebrate Columbo Day than to actually watch Columbo? Here's where you can watch this critically acclaimed show:<p>

Besides weird TV channels like MeTV (?), the Hallmark Movies & Mysteries channel seems to show [episodes of "Columbo"](http://www.hallmarkmoviesandmysteries.com/search?q=columbo). Check your local listings for details.<p>

Although it seems like full episode clips are taken down for copyright issues, there are plenty of classic "Columbo" clips on Youtube! Just search for "columbo" to watch!<p>

"Columbo" is only available through Netflix on DVD so by the time you're reading this it's probably too late to get it for Columbo Day. Maybe you live close to a Netflix distribution center and can drive over there?<p>

Don't you sort of wish Blockbuster was still around? Would've been nice to be able to drive over to your local store and rent a few seasons :(

<h2>Other stores?</h2>
Maybe your local store will sell you a DVD of the show? If you know of a good lead, let us know at <a href="mailto:columboday@aol.com">columboday@aol.com</a>!
