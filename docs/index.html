<h1>On October 9th, 2017, let&rsquo;s celebrate Columbo Day instead of that other guy!</h1></p>

<h2>But wait, who's Columbo, you say?</h2>

<p><img src="img/columbo.jpg" alt="columbo" /></p>

<p>Lt. Columbo was a Los Angeles detective, portrayed by actor Peter Falk between 1968 and 2003 and the television show &ldquo;Columbo.&rdquo; Columbo&rsquo;s investigations almost always revolve around the rich and famous of L.A. He solves cases not by abusing people, but by using his wits. He would make suspects think he was a simpleton fool until his classic &ldquo;Just one more thing&hellip;&rdquo; question would reveal them as the criminal that they always were!</p>

<h2>Why Columbo Day?</h2>

<p>Maybe this table comparing the two will help:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Did he...</th>
    <th>Christopher Columbus</th>
    <th>Lt. Columbo</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>massacre thousands of people?</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>enslave people?</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>take part in sex trafficking?</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>solve criminal cases?</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td>discover America?</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>prove the Earth is round?</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>drive a 1959 Peugeot 403 convertible?</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>I think it's pretty clear from this table that Columbo is a lot better than Christopher Columbus. So shouldn't we celebrate Columbo on this day instead? Have fun "surfing" the rest of this website to learn more about Columbo and...Happy Columbo Day!</h2>
