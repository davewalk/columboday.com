      <description>What better to celebrate Columbo Day than to actually watch Columbo? Here&amp;rsquo;s where you can watch this critically acclaimed show:
Besides weird TV channels like MeTV (?), the Hallmark Movies &amp;amp; Mysteries channel seems to show episodes of &amp;ldquo;Columbo&amp;rdquo;. Check your local listings for details.
Although it seems like full episode clips are taken down for copyright issues, there are plenty of classic &amp;ldquo;Columbo&amp;rdquo; clips on Youtube! Just search for &amp;ldquo;columbo&amp;rdquo; to watch!</description>
